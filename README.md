## Details

This is a static gastby site deployed to Netlify

## Retrospective

I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, and actively use it. The original idea was to create a site that I could set as my browser homepage (hence homepage-notes), and write a single message to remind myself to not waste time on the internet. This evolved into a general note taking app, where you could jot down any sort of note (jote = jot note).


Goals:
* Create a small useful website for taking down notes
* NOT require users to create an account or log in
* Try out Netlify for deploying static sites

If I had more time, things I would add:
* More unit tests. I essentially set them up for local storage but never fleshed them out for any other part of the app

If I could do it over again, things I would change:
* I would put more thought into how the components are organized
* The layout of the major components (header, main, footer) is a little brittle and requires tinkering whenever I want to make some general changes. I would like to go back and rethink that.
